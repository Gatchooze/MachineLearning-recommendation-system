# MachineLearning-recommendation-system (G-Parking Project)

Location Based Recommendation System

We create a recommendation system so that users can get the right recommendations. The places we recommend are selected based on the location, rating, and the number of users who rate it so that users also get the best recommendations close to them. We cluster the mall based on the previously mentioned indicators using K-Means algorithm. We use dummy data for rating because currently we only provide 10 mallls and in the future we will use the rating data entered by the users.

Indicator   : location, rating, number of  users who rate the mall

Model       : Scikit-learn/sklearn

Algorithm   : K-Means Algorithm

Rating Data : Dummy data

The model is integrated in Google Cloud Platform by cloud learning path members using Flask Framework.
